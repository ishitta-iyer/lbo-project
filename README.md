# lbo-project
This is an LBO for Neilson holdings, a company purchased by Evergreen corp. I have made an excel file with an LBO in as much detail as possible, and then I have tried to import that into python and recaclulate it after predicting revenues myself using brownian motion. I then did monte carlo to check if my IRR distribution made sense.
